## Feedback

I'm new to React, so if you don't mind to help me, you can give me an advice to make my code better.

1. Fork it (<https://github.com/nubilfi/React-Book-Library/fork>)
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/BestPractice`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some BestPractice'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/BestPractice`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
